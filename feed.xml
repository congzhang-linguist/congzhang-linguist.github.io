This study explored the routes to diagnosis for HNC patients to understand factors influencing experiences and identify opportunities for earlier diagnosis. Using a multi-method approach, the study analysed data from Public Health England on 68,752 HNC patients and conducted qualitative interviews with HNC patients and clinicians involved in the diagnosis of HNC. The findings reveal socio-demographic inequalities in diagnosis routes, challenges in symptom recognition, healthcare access, and fragmented communication. The study suggests adapting the Model of Total Patient Delay to incorporate health literacy for better understanding patient delays and improving early diagnosis.</p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="1500--1600-24th-oct-2024"><strong>15:00 ‚Äì 16:00 24th Oct 2024</strong></h4> <p>‚≠ê<strong>An implementation science framework for increasing partnership working between early childhood educators and speech and language therapists: cracking NNUTS</strong> <br/> üéì<em>Prof. Helen Stringer, Newcastle University</em></p> <p>üìç<strong>Location</strong>: Lecture Theatre 4, King George VI Building, Newcastle University<br/> üñ•Ô∏è<strong>Zoom Meeting ID</strong>: 687 395 3555</p> <p>üìÉAbstract: <br/> Background: Partnership working by speech &amp; language therapists (SLTs) and early childhood educators (ECEs) can effectively enhance the language environment in educational settings and support universal, targeted and specialist interventions for children with speech and language delay. However, such models are difficult to sustain over time. This study uses an implementation science model to design, implement and evaluate a behaviour change framework for increasing partnership working between SLTs and ECEs.</p> <p>Method: The Northumbria Healthcare-Newcastle University Universal-Targeted-Specialist (NNUTS) Framework utilised behaviour change methodology to develop a programme of training for SLTs to increase their knowledge of educational practice and their ability to utilise social capital techniques when working in educational settings. Tools to support ECEs implement SLT interventions in the educational setting were developed and evaluated. Online surveys and focus groups were used to discover the barriers and enablers to partnership working for SLTs and ECEs. A series of face to face interviews explored the factors that promoted sustainability.</p> <p>Results: Barriers to partnership working comprised mainly of time and physical resources. Close collaboration of SLT and ECE managers led to increased support for SLTs and ECEs in the classroom, protected time for training and implementation of SLT programmes, increased access for SLTs and more appropriate referrals to SLT.</p> <p>Conclusion: An implementation science approach, incorporating behaviour change and social capital theories, provides for a replicable methodology for developing and sustaining partnership working: the NNUTS Framework.</p> <p><br/></p> <h4 id="1500--1600-28th-nov-2024"><strong>15:00 ‚Äì 16:00 28th Nov 2024</strong></h4> <p>‚≠ê<strong>The time course of first impression formation from voices</strong><br/> üéì<em>Dr. Nadine Lavan, Queen Mary</em></p> <p>üìç<strong>Location</strong>: Lecture Theatre 4, King George VI Building, Newcastle University<br/> üñ•Ô∏è<strong>Zoom Meeting ID</strong>: 687 395 3555</p> <p>üìÉAbstract:<br/> Listeners very quickly form impressions of a person from their voice: Is someone old or young?

According to Hume, cognition and affect, thinking and feeling, reason and passion ‚Äì often analysed as two opposing forces ‚Äì work together in complex ways. His view foreshadowed the work of Kahneman and Tversky (1974) on cognitive biases, according to which decision-making involves hot-headed emotional choices as much as cool, logical ones.</p> <p>Given that (a) modern theories of pragmatics assume that human communication is ‚Äòinferential‚Äô ‚Äì i.e. rooted in reasoning and rationality and (b) the communication of information about emotional states is ubiquitous among humans, one could be forgiven for assuming that pragmatic accounts of linguistic communication would include quite well-developed views of the roles played in both by affect and emotion. However, for a range of reasons, scholars have tended to persist with the view that the mental processes behind reason and passions exist in separate domains. Consequently, the emotional dimension to linguistic communication has tended to play only a background role. Indeed, in most accounts it plays no role at all.</p> <p>In this talk I present some of the reasons why affect has been side-lined in this way and assess the main challenges to accommodating affect and emotion within a theory of pragmatics. I also provide an overview of ongoing collaborative work with the Swiss Centre for Affective Science (CISA) that builds on previous work (see Wharton et al. 2021, Wharton and de Saussure 2023) and explores the idea of a methodological merger between the pragmatic framework of Relevance Theory (Sperber and Wilson 1986/1995), and the affective science framework, Appraisal Theory (Ellsworth 2013, Scherer and Moors 2019). The merger attempts a ‚Äòbottom-up‚Äô reworking of the pragmatics of affect, which begins from fundamental assumptions rather than the more ‚Äòtop-down‚Äô approach adopted by many, which adds bolted-on extras. Such an approach embeds advances in pragmatics within the development of recent approaches to emotion as cognitive appraisals and demonstrates the importance of keeping affect in mind.</p> <p>Kahneman, D. &amp; A.

Adaptive Interaction (AI) uses nonverbal channels to connect with people living with dementia who can no longer speak.

Building on this evidence base, the MEAD project is developing a new measure to support ongoing opportunities for meaningful engagement, authentic caring relationships and creating and maintaining a supportive community for individuals who can no longer speak.

I will be reporting on an ongoing research project at Uppsala University that involves 223 bilingual preschool and primary-school children from mixed socioeconomic (SES) backgrounds whose home language is Arabic or Turkish and who are schooled in the majority language Swedish (Swedish Research Council 2014-2019, Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation 2020-2025). Arabic and Turkish are two of the largest immigrant languages in Sweden. The children were tested in both their languages on a range of experimental language tasks from the LITMUS battery, developed specifically for the assessment of bilingual children (COST Action IS0804, https://www.bi-sli.org). We included measures of phonological processing (quasi-universal, cross-linguistic and language-specific nonword repetition tasks), receptive and expressive vocabulary, story comprehension (inferential comprehension of macrostructure) and story production (Multilingual Assessment of Narratives, MAIN, Gagarina et al. 2019). These tasks are complemented by collecting extensive information via parental questionnaires and interviews, and for a subsample, also via home observations (in Turkish/Arabic), school observations, teacher interviews, SLP interviews and longitudinal follow-ups. 17 of the children had a diagnosis of DLD. So far, we have investigated the cross-sectional data (4;0‚Äí8;1) in relation to age, language exposure, SES, and ‚Äì for NWR and narratives ‚Äì in relation to vocabulary, and we are currently analysing the longitudinal data (from age 4‚Äí5 to age 9‚Äí10). The DLD children are being investigated more in depth on an individual basis, to see whether and how their performance on the LITMUS language tasks stands out in perspicuous ways from that of the ‚Äòtypically developing‚Äô (TD) children, either in the majority language Swedish and/or in the home language Arabic/Turkish. I will be reporting on some of these findings. I will also discuss whether background factors, particularly information on language exposure, can help us interpret the language scores when TD and DLD performances overlap, and what might be considered a warning sign for DLD in bilingual children age 4‚Äí8.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sls-seminar"/><category term="sls-seminar"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semester 2, 2024]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My name</title><link href="https://congzhang-linguist.github.io/blog/2023/my-name/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My name"/><published>2023-07-22T16:39:00+01:00</published><updated>2023-07-22T16:39:00+01:00</updated><id>https://congzhang-linguist.github.io/blog/2023/my-name</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://congzhang-linguist.github.io/blog/2023/my-name/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="my-name-in-mandarin">My name in Mandarin</h2> <p>My name is Âº†zhang (IPA: [t É…ë≈ã]) ËÅ™cong (IPA: [ts ∞ ä≈ã]).
