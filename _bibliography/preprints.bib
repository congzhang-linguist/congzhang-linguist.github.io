    abstract={This study investigates whether phonological features can be applied in text-to-speech systems to generate native and non-native speech. We present a mapping between ARPABET/pinyin->SAMPA/SAMPA-SC->phonological features in this paper, and tested whether native, non-native, and code-switched speech could be successfully generated using this mapping. We ran two experiments, one with a small dataset and one with a larger dataset. The results proved that phonological features can be a feasible input system, although it needs further investigation to improve model performance. The accented output generated by the TTS models also helps with understanding human second language acquisition processes.},

    title={Floating Boundary Tone: Production and Perception of Syntactically Unmarked Polar Question in Tianjin Mandarin},
    author={Zhang, Cong and Lahiri, Aditi},

    abstract={The present study investigates the intonational tune of syntactically unmarked polar question in Tianjin Mandarin. A production study was conducted to examine the phonological features of the syntactically unmarked polar question (a.k.a intonational yes/no question) tune by comparing against the statement tune. The results show a significant register lift HR and a high floating boundary tone HÌ¥I. The tone shape and tone register played a significant role in how the tunes vary. A tune identification task then further verifies whether the two prosodic features concluded from the production are used in perception. The results showed that both the register difference and the boundary tone made a difference in native speakers' perception in discriminating questions from statements.},
