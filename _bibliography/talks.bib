Identification of latent aphasia is challenging and very little is known about speech output in this aphasia type. To address these knowledge gaps, we examined: (1) how latent aphasia affects features of expressive prosody according to different word positions in utterances. (2) To investigate whether prosody markers can identify people with latent aphasia versus neurotypical controls. (3) To explore the potential of expressive prosody and demographic information in correctly classifying people with latent aphasia versus neurotypical controls.}

Unlike prior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia, which can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech. We analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and utterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching controls. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this understudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees of differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also investigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus neurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable tool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest analysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in distinguishing latent aphasia.}

	abstract = {Prosody in Korean is associated with grammatical mood. We examine the phenomenon by which sentences that are ambiguous between statements, open and polar questions are disambiguated through prosodic cues. Some accounts rely on placement of accentual phrase boundaries, while others propose an expanded pitch range (Jun & Oh, 1996; Jones, 2016). We argue that a minimum degree of pitch expansion is required to convey focus; that — contra previous accounts — the left edge of pitch range expansion is more important; and that the pitch expansion duration is secondary to alignment of the edges of expanded pitch range and the scope of focus. }

    abstract={Previous research suggests that words with a high level of language redundancy (i.e. recognition likelihood from familiarity and predictability based
    on syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic factors) have reduced acoustic salience, such as shorter duration and reduced vowels. The Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis proposes that acoustic salience is controlled via prosodic structure, and makes the prediction that parameters such as fundamental frequency should also be affected by language redundancy. This study investigates the relationship of F0 with lexical frequency, together with bigram (verb-adjective or adjective-noun) frequency and the ratio between these two bigram frequencies. Results from a carefully controlled experiment with quadruplets of minimal pairs suggests that language redundancy can affect fundamental frequency in English.},

The results lend support to FUL by presenting successfully synthesised output, and by having the output carrying a source-language accent when synthesising a language not in the training data. The TTS process stimulated second language acquisition process and thus also confirm FUL’s ability to account for acquisition.}

We have curated a G2P dataset from various sources that covers around 100 languages and trained large-scale multilingual G2P models based on ByT5. We found that ByT5 operating on byte-level inputs significantly outperformed the token-based mT5 model in terms of multilingual G2P. Pairwise comparison with monolingual models in these languages suggests that multilingual ByT5 models generally lower the phone error rate by jointly learning from a variety of languages. The pretrained model can further benefit low resource G2P through zero-shot prediction on unseen languages or provides pretrained weights for finetuning, which helps the model converge to a lower phone error rate than randomly initialized weights. To facilitate future research on multilingual G2P, we make available our code and pretrained multilingual G2P models at: https://github.com/lingjzhu/CharsiuG2P.}

The proposed Wav2Vec2-FS, a semi-supervised model, directly learns phone-to-audio alignment through contrastive learning and a forward sum loss, and can be coupled with a pretrained phone recognizer to achieve text-independent alignment. The other model, Wav2Vec2-FC, is a frame classification model trained on forced aligned labels that can both perform forced alignment and text-independent segmentation. Evaluation results suggest that both proposed methods, even when transcriptions are not available, generate highly close results to existing forced alignment tools.

The accents (N = 748) were elicited from native speakers of Greek, producing scripted and unscripted speech, and examined using functional Principal Components Analysis. The accented vowel onset was used for landmark registration to capture accent shape and the alignment of the fall. The resulting PCs were analysed using LMEMs (fixed factors: speaker; task type (scripted, unscripted); accented syllable distance from the analysis window offset, to examine the effects of tonal crowding). Tonal scaling and the steepness of the fall (reflected in PC1 and PC2 respectively) changed by task in ways that differed across speakers. PC3, which captured accent shape, also varied by speaker, reflecting shape differences between a rise-fall and (the expected) plateau-plus-fall realization. Tonal crowding did not have consistent effects. In short, the overall accent shape and the alignment of the accentual fall varied by speaker and task. These results hint at substantial variability in tonal realization. At the same time, they indicate that tonal alignment is not as consistent as is sometimes portrayed and thus it should not be the sole criterion for tone categorization.}

We used Rapid Prosody Transcription to test these two views.

If L+H* is an emphatic H*, L+H*s should be rated more prominent than H*s; if the accents encode a pragmatic distinction, contrastive accents should be rated more prominent than non-contrastive ones. The results showed effects of both accent and pragmatics (L+H* > H*; contrastive > non-contrastive) and no interaction. Contrastive L+H*s were rated most prominent, non-contrastive H*s least prominent, while non-contrastive L+H*s and contrastive H*s had average and almost identical ratings. Participants used different strategies: some focused on accent type, others on pragmatics, and still others made neither distinction. These results suggest that a reason for the continuing debate about H* and L+H* may be that the accents form a weak contrast which some speakers acquire and attend to while others do not. Similarly, researchers who focus on contrastive L+H* and non-contrastive H* see distinct categories, while those who focus on non-contrastive L+H*s and contrastive H*s tend to see a continuum.}

Therefore, the availability of the information on the temporal relationship between speech segments and music beats is crucial. The current study investigated the segment-beat synchronisation in singing data, with hypotheses formed based on the linguistics theories of P-centre and sonority hierarchy. A Mandarin corpus and an English corpus of professional singing data were manually annotated and analysed. The results showed that the presence of musical beats was more dependent on segment duration than sonority. However, the sonority hierarchy and the P-centre theory were highly related to the location of beats. Mandarin and English demonstrated cross-linguistic variations despite exhibiting common patterns.}

Sound-treated recording spaces and high-quality recording devices are inaccessible, and face-to-face interactions are limited. We investigated alternative recording methods that produce data suitable for phonetic analysis, and are accessible to people in their homes. We examined simultaneous recordings of pure tones at seven frequencies (50 Hz, every 100 Hz between 100 Hz and 600 Hz), and three repetitions of the primary cardinal vowels elicited from five trained speakers. Recordings were made using the ZOOM meeting application and non-lossy format smartphone applications (Awesome Voice Recorder, Recorder), comparing these with Zoom H6N reference recordings. F0, F1-5, and duration based on manual segmentation were measured. F0 is highly correlated between the three devices for vowels and tones. Lower formants are also significantly correlated though not as robustly. The upper formants showed more variation as reported in the literature. Both phone and ZOOM performed better for vowels than tones. Phone segmentation generated reliable duration values differing from H6N segmentation by ∼18 ms. However, irregular waveforms and filtering algorithm artefacts caused considerable differences for ZOOM (∼119 ms). Our preliminary study suggests phone recordings are a viable option for some phonetic studies (e.g., prosody). Future analysis of natural speech data will prove insightful.}

    abstract     = {Text-to-sing generates singing from text input (i.e., music score with lyrics), from which only syllable-level speech-music alignment can be acquired. To enhance the text-to-sing models, more fine-grained phoneme-level information is needed. We therefore investigate the acoustic measurements of segments and their temporal relationship with music beats as an answer from a linguistics perspective. Two research questions are addressed: (1) Do beats align with syllable onsets or nuclear vowel onsets? (2) Do different types of consonants present different speech-beat alignment results? Unaccompanied singing by professional singers in two rhythmically dissimilar languages, English (15 songs) and Mandarin (25 songs), were analysed. Data were segmented manually into phonemes by a trained annotator; a music scholar independently labelled the beats. Preliminary results suggest that Mandarin songs strongly favour vowels as anchors for beats (66.7%) while only 52.9% of beats fall on vowels in English. Both languages show that the beats have a strong preference for the end of consonants and the beginning of vowels. Phoneme types also play a significant role in the speech-beat alignment distribution. Future modelling of the speech-beat alignment in singing and comparison with speech rhythm data will also contribute to linguistic rhythm theories.}

One of the most noticeable issues is the segment duration and proportion in synthesised singing, which is caused by the difference in the short syllables in speech and the lengthened syllables in singing. This study therefore investigates how syllables are lengthened in Mandarin singing data. A total of 20 songs from the MIREX singing corpus were segmented and analysed. The results showed that (1) the segment proportions in Mandarin syllables are different in speech and in singing; (2) the lengthening is influenced more by the slots in the syllable structure than by the types of segments; (3) in the syllable structure of CGVX in Mandarin, the nuclear V lengthens the most and X follows. The durations of C and G also increase but their proportions in a syllable decrease.}

Six native Tianjin speakers’ production of disyllabic names and kinship terms were recorded. The speech materials were composed of a set of left-prominent disyllabic names and a set of right-prominent disyllabic names. The results show that there is a L% boundary tone at the end of the intonational phrase, regardless of the lexical tones. Different from the IntQ data, the L% boundary tone is phonetically manifested and overrode the lexical tone contours. A H* pitch accent was found to be associated with the H of each lexical tone. Lengthening was also found in the CC tune. The CC tune in Tianjin Mandarin can be represented as follows: [[H*]sustained]higher register + L%.}

    abstract     = {Analysing the role of input in driving L2 development in and out of the classroom is essential to understand the interrelation between what learners know and how they use what they know. For western learners of L2 Mandarin, input is typically very limited outside the classroom, and may be often based on traditional grammar-based modes of teaching involving large amounts of explicit formulaic learning. Tracking changes in L2 proficiency among such learners, e.g. moving from limited use of learned chunks to creative linguistic competence (in spoken or written form), can thus be helpful to inform the generalisability of models of L2 development, often derived from studies of communicative or CLT approaches. 
    
    This study aims to shed light on the newly emerging field of instructed L2 Mandarin development, by examining effects of moving to an input-rich environment during Study Abroad, to see how far this can foster improvements in fluency, grammatical accuracy/ complexity and lexical diversity. We present data from a set of 10 adult English university learners of Mandarin measured before and after ten months studying abroad (SA), using three written and four speaking tasks to track linguistic changes in grammatical development and oral fluency (Freed et al. 2004, Pallotti 2009). 
    
    Written tasks were measured for grammatical accuracy, total length, and morpheme development (targeting de-possessive, de-relative, shi-copula, and le-perfective). Oral proficiency was measured for total output, grammatical accuracy, pronunciation, lexical development, MLU, hesitation rate, use of pausing, speech rate and phonation time ratio. Information was also gathered on language contact by measuring hours and type of language use during Study Abroad. Writing scores showed little change, other than in greater total length (ns), although there was some evidence of improved grammatical range, with greater use of de-relative (p < .01) by time 2. Oral proficiency scores showed more consistent improved significantly (p < .05), especially overall speech rate (p <.01). However, more fine-grained analysis showed that all measures varied greatly by task, and were very variable across the group. Our study highlights the value of longitudinal SLA-motivated studies of language learners moving between instructed and immersed contexts, but also notes the lack of standardised linguistically-informed measures to elicit reliable evidence of development in instructed L2 Mandarin (Du 2013). We will address how further research could address some of the theoretical, methodological and pedagogical issues involved in analysing systematic linguistic development in instructed L2 Mandarin.

We used two speaking tasks comparing pre-planned vs. unplanned spontaneous speech to compare differences over time and between tasks, using eight linguistic and temporal fluency measures (analysed using CLAN and PRAAT). Overall mean linguistic and temporal fluency scores improved significantly (p < .05), especially speech rate (p <.01), supporting the general claim that SA favours oral development, particularly fluency. Further analysis revealed task differences at both times of measurement, but with greater improvement in the spontaneous task.}

    abstract     = {The investigation of L2 fluency in recent decades has brought increasing rigour and understanding of its complex nature and role within the broad sense of L2 acquisition (Freed et al., 2004; Kormos, 2011). Nevertheless, L2 fluency remains difficult to define and measure consistently, particularly across the two dimensions of cognitive and utterance fluency (Segalowitz, 2010). There is, we argue, a separation of methods between these two dimensions, effectively creating a distinction between linguistic and temporal fluency research. Linguistic fluency studies, e.g. using CLAN, tend to focus on changes across a mix of measures, including morphosyntactic accuracy and lexical diversity, using both monologic and interactional tasks. Temporal fluency studies, e.g. using PRAAT, tend to focus on more fine-grained changes in speech rate and breakdown to reflect automaticity in utterance production, usually measured in monologic speech. The two dimensions clearly overlap in many aspects, but studies which specifically focus on combining both are rare, despite their value in understanding fluency in a more holistic way. This is particularly true for L2 Mandarin, currently under-researched in SLA fluency studies. 

    The study reported here, examining longitudinal changes in L2 Mandarin fluency, thus aims to add to our understanding of fluency at the linguistic/temporal interface by reporting on data, gathered across four monologic and dialogic tasks, involving prepared and unprepared speech, and analysed using both CLAN and PRAAT. Participants are ten adult L1 English learners of Mandarin, assessed before and after a year's Study Abroad. We found that across tasks, oral measures generally showed clear improvement: in particular total mean output, speech rate, phonological accuracy increased significantly (p <.01). However, other measures such as accuracy and lexical diversity, hesitation and mean length of run differed between task, and were very variable across the group, highlighting individual differences particularly in processing prepared vs. unprepared speech demands. Even within the same task expected correlations between CLAN-based and PRAAT measures were not consistently found. 

    This study highlights the value of collecting detailed longitudinal SLA-motivated datasets of language learners moving between instructed and immersed contexts (Du 2013), and using theoretically-grounded comparisons of linguistic and temporal fluency. However, there remain clear challenges for researching L2 fluency, especially comparing monologic vs dialogic tasks and prepared vs. unprepared speech (Pallotti 2009). We discuss theoretical, methodological and pedagogical implications of our data for systematic analysis of L2 oral development, particularly in L2 Mandarin}

We used four speaking tasks to track changes in general oral proficiency and temporal fluency. General oral proficiency was measured as total output, MLU, grammatical accuracy, lexical development, pronunciation, number and type of filled pauses and hesitation rate (number of repetitions and repairs per word count), using CLAN analyses. Temporal fluency was measured by speech rate, articulation rate, phonation time ratio, number and length of silent pauses. Given the nature of Mandarin, calculations usually based on word or syllable are all here shown as based on single characters.  Overall mean oral proficiency scores improved significantly (p < .05), especially overall speech rate (p <.01), supporting the general claim that SA favours oral development, particularly fluency (Collentine and Freed 2004).

We used three writing tasks and four speaking tasks as measures of writing and speaking proficiency, to examine changes in total output, grammatical accuracy, lexical development, pronunciation and fluency, repeated before and after the ten months’ SA in China. Overall mean oral proficiency scores improved significantly (p < .05), especially overall speech rate (p <.01), supporting the general claim that SA favours oral development, particularly fluency (Collentine and Freed 2004). However, more fine-grained analysis showed that spoken measures varied greatly by task, and were very variable across the group, highlighting the difficulty in clarifying precisely how to assess oral proficiency, or communicative competence. Written development showed fewer marked improvement: only one writing test (an untimed short essay) significantly improved in length (p <.05), and in increased complex grammar (use of de-relative clause morphemes, p <.001). A sub-group (n=7) provided quantitative and qualitative data on L2 Chinese use at different times during SA, showing marked individual differences in the SA experience. Our study highlights the value of longitudinal SLA-motivated studies of language learners moving between instructed and immersed contexts, but also notes the importance of capturing individual students’ experiences during SA (Regan et al. 2009). We also note the lack of standardised linguistically-informed measures to provide reliable evidence of language development in instructed L2 Chinese, particularly in spoken language (De Jong et al. 2012; Freed et al. 2004; Pallotti 2009; Zhang 2005). Further research is therefore much needed to identify systematic linguistic development in L2 Chinese, and also to bridge theory and practice in L2 Chinese language teaching, in order to clarify the interconnecting factors, in and out of the classroom, which affect L2 Chinese language development.}
