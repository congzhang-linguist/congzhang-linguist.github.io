    abstract     = {This paper aims to more precisely specify the nature of pitch expansion in question focus in Korean, as a precursor to the computational modelling of a discriminative learning process based on prosodic cues. The work is important because it strengthens a potential account that allows formal links between prosody and syntactic analysis. In focusing on phenomena at the trailing edge of the scope of focus, it can be used alongside left-to-right statistical machine translation to improve the output of speech recognition systems, without requiring a full statistical parse of the input, and in speech generation systems to reduce the ambiguity of output.}

    abstract={Previous research suggests that words with a high level of language redundancy (i.e. recognition likelihood from familiarity and predictability based
    on syntactic, pragmatic, and semantic factors) have reduced acoustic salience, such as shorter duration and reduced vowels. The Smooth Signal Redundancy Hypothesis proposes that acoustic salience is controlled via prosodic structure, and makes the prediction that parameters such as fundamental frequency should also be affected by language redundancy. This study investigates the relationship of F0 with lexical frequency, together with bigram (verb-adjective or adjective-noun) frequency and the ratio between these two bigram frequencies. Results from a carefully controlled experiment with quadruplets of minimal pairs suggests that language redundancy can affect fundamental frequency in English.},
