    abstract     = {This talk will address the issue of imbalanced development in linguistics between well-resourced and under-resourced languages. One of the primary reasons for this imbalance is the lack of research tools and resources for under-resourced languages, including for data collection, analysis, and processing. This can make it challenging for linguists to conduct research on under-resourced languages, as they may not have access to the same level of technology and infrastructure that is available for well-resourced languages. Addressing this issue is an essential step towards promoting inclusivity in the field of linguistics. In this talk, I will present some research findings, tools, and resources that have been developed to facilitate linguistic research on under-resourced languages, including options for remote phonetic data collection, an automatic phonetic recogniser and aligner which can be trained with data from different language varieties, and a grapheme-to-phoneme modelling framework and relevant resources, which can help researchers work with under-resourced languages.}

    abstract     = {Both lexical tone and intonation are mainly realised through pitch modulation. This often causes the misunderstanding of tonal languages having no intonation or limited intonation. In fact, tonal languages can have more complex prosodic patterns than expected. In this talk, I will present how different types of boundary tones – floating boundary tone and actual boundary tones (mono-tonal, bi-tonal, and more) – can be used for a range of linguistic and para-linguistic functions in Tianjin Mandarin and Standard Mandarin.}

    abstract     = {Speech technology has been advancing at an unprecedented speed due to the revitalisation of machine learning and ever-so-growing available data. Whilst speech technology deals with language, linguistic knowledge is used less and less in the process. However, using what we already know about languages may give us an advantage over the black-box algorithms. Making use of up-to-date and suitable linguistics knowledge can reduce the amount of data needed, save time and costs, allow the models to be more interpretable and controllable, and eventually may lead to new methodological development. In this talk, I will talk about how linguistics knowledge can be applied to ASR and TTS in various ways, in hope of bridging the gap between linguistics and engineering.}
