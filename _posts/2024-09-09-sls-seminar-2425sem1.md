⭐**"I thought there would have been pain": An exploration of the routes to diagnosis in head and neck cancer**

📃Abstract:  
Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the 6th most diagnosed cancer worldwide and often identified at a late stage due to vague symptoms that are easily mistaken for benign conditions. This study explored the routes to diagnosis for HNC patients to understand factors influencing experiences and identify opportunities for earlier diagnosis. Using a multi-method approach, the study analysed data from Public Health England on 68,752 HNC patients and conducted qualitative interviews with HNC patients and clinicians involved in the diagnosis of HNC. The findings reveal socio-demographic inequalities in diagnosis routes, challenges in symptom recognition, healthcare access, and fragmented communication. The study suggests adapting the Model of Total Patient Delay to incorporate health literacy for better understanding patient delays and improving early diagnosis.

⭐**An implementation science framework for increasing partnership working between early childhood educators and speech and language therapists: cracking NNUTS**    
🎓*Prof. Helen Stringer, Newcastle University*   

📍**Location**: Lecture Theatre 4, King George VI Building, Newcastle University  
🖥️**Zoom Meeting ID**: 687 395 3555  
  
📃Abstract:     
Background: Partnership working by speech & language therapists (SLTs) and early childhood educators (ECEs) can effectively enhance the language environment in educational settings and support universal, targeted and specialist interventions for children with speech and language delay. However, such models are difficult to sustain over time. This study uses an implementation science model to design, implement and evaluate a behaviour change framework for increasing partnership working between SLTs and ECEs.

Method: The Northumbria Healthcare-Newcastle University Universal-Targeted-Specialist (NNUTS) Framework utilised behaviour change methodology to develop a programme of training for SLTs to increase their knowledge of educational practice and their ability to utilise social capital techniques when working in educational settings. Tools to support ECEs implement SLT interventions in the educational setting were developed and evaluated. Online surveys and focus groups were used to discover the barriers and enablers to partnership working for SLTs and ECEs. A series of face to face interviews explored the factors that promoted sustainability.

Results: Barriers to partnership working comprised mainly of time and physical resources. Close collaboration of SLT and ECE managers led to increased support for SLTs and ECEs in the classroom, protected time for training and implementation of SLT programmes, increased access for SLTs and more appropriate referrals to SLT.

Conclusion: An implementation science approach, incorporating behaviour change and social capital theories, provides for a replicable methodology for developing and sustaining partnership working: the NNUTS Framework.
