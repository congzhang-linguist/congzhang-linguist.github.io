## Research areas
I am interested in supervising PhD students who would like to work on:  

- any topic related to **speech prosody**  
For instance, production and/or perception of lexical tone/intonation in any language; tone-intonation interaction; syntax-prosody interface; non-native listening; L1 or L2 acquisition of prosody; prosody modelling; etc.  

- theory-driven **speech technology** (TTS, ASR) research  
I am interested using *small data* and to conduct *theory-driven* research on speech technology. The theory can be linguistic, mathematic, psycho- or neuro- linguistic. Or a combination. I have some ready topics and specific plans. If you have experience in building models for speech technology, you are very welcome to apply for a PhD. It is likely that funding will be available in the future.  


## Second supervisor
In Newcastle, every PhD student is supervised by two supervisors. Depending on your background, you can find another supervisor to complement my knowledge and skills.

#### If you have a language/linguistics background:
There are three schools related to language/linguistic research:  
- to combine your research with other aspects of phonetics and phonology, syntax, pragmatics, socio-linguistics, acquisition, etc., look here: [English Literature, Language and Linguistics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/elll/people/language-linguistics/)
- to combine your research with translation/interpreting or a specific modern language, look here: [School of Modern Languages](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/sml/our-people/)
- to combine your research with applied linguistics such as conversation analysis or pedagogical research, look here: [Applied Linguistics and Communication](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/ecls/people/linguistics-communication/)

#### If you have a psychology/neuroscience/clinical background:
- to research on language and speech disorders, look here: [Speech and Language Sciences](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/ecls/people/speech-language/)
- to work on other aspects of psycho-/neuro-linguistics, look here: [Faculty of Medical Sciences](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/medical-sciences/people/academic/)


#### If you have a mathematics/engineering background:
- to work on theory-driven speech technology and have a mathematics/engineering background, [Professor Hongsheng Dai](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/people/profile/hongshengdai.html) is happy to co-supervise. You can choose to be affiliated with the [School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/)
- there may also be suitable supervisors in [School of Computing](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/computing/staff/academic/)


## Ranking
While ranking doesn't mean as much for a PhD student, it is important to point out that
- Newcastle University is a Russell Group university (somewhat like Ivy-league in the US);
- Newcastle's language-related degrees are internationally renowned, e.g. the department I am affiliated with, language and speech therapy, always ranks in the top 3 nationwide: [link](https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings/speech-and-language-therapy)  
This is partically due to the (not very far) history, the majority of the linguistics department was moved from Durham University to Newcastle.

## Funding
The major funding sources for art, humanities, and social sciences are:
- [North East Doctoral Training Centre studentship](https://www.ninedtp.ac.uk/)
- [Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Centre studentships ](http://www.northernbridge.ac.uk/)
- [IDEALAB](https://phd-idealab.com/#:~:text=IDEALAB%20The%20PhD%20Program%20International%20Doctorate%20for%20Experimental,and%20foundations%20of%20human%20language%20integrating%20interdisciplinary%20approaches.)  
- [Stroke Association fellowships](https://www.stroke.org.uk/research/our-funding-schemes)   

For more detailed information for the above four, see [here](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/ecls/study-with-us/postgraduate-research/phd-opportunities/).

- [China Scholarship Council](http://apply.csc.edu.cn/) (for Chinese citizens only)
- [Marie Curie](https://www.findaphd.com/guides/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions-msca-phd-funding)

Newcastle also have many opportunities for being a teaching assistant which can cover a large percentage of the cost.
Newcastle, as a city, also has very low housing price and low living cost.
