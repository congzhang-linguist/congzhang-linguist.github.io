⭐**Affect in Mind**  
🎓*Dr. Tim Wharton, University of Brighton*

📃Abstract:  
When David Hume wrote ‘Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions’ he famously articulated a view of the relationship between rationality or reasoning on the one hand and emotions or ‘passions’ on the other. According to Hume, cognition and affect, thinking and feeling, reason and passion – often analysed as two opposing forces – work together in complex ways. His view foreshadowed the work of Kahneman and Tversky (1974) on cognitive biases, according to which decision-making involves hot-headed emotional choices as much as cool, logical ones.

Given that (a) modern theories of pragmatics assume that human communication is ‘inferential’ – i.e. rooted in reasoning and rationality and (b) the communication of information about emotional states is ubiquitous among humans, one could be forgiven for assuming that pragmatic accounts of linguistic communication would include quite well-developed views of the roles played in both by affect and emotion. However, for a range of reasons, scholars have tended to persist with the view that the mental processes behind reason and passions exist in separate domains. Consequently, the emotional dimension to linguistic communication has tended to play only a background role. Indeed, in most accounts it plays no role at all.

In this talk I present some of the reasons why affect has been side-lined in this way and assess the main challenges to accommodating affect and emotion within a theory of pragmatics. I also provide an overview of ongoing collaborative work with the Swiss Centre for Affective Science (CISA) that builds on previous work (see Wharton et al. 2021, Wharton and de Saussure 2023) and explores the idea of a methodological merger between the pragmatic framework of Relevance Theory (Sperber and Wilson 1986/1995), and the affective science framework, Appraisal Theory (Ellsworth 2013, Scherer and Moors 2019). The merger attempts a ‘bottom-up’ reworking of the pragmatics of affect, which begins from fundamental assumptions rather than the more ‘top-down’ approach adopted by many, which adds bolted-on extras. Such an approach embeds advances in pragmatics within the development of recent approaches to emotion as cognitive appraisals and demonstrates the importance of keeping affect in mind.

⭐**Measuring Engagement in Advanced Dementia (MEAD): Extending Adaptive Interaction**    
🎓*Prof. Arlene Astell, Northumbria University*   

📍**Location**: Lecture Theatre 4, King George VI Building, Newcastle University  
🖥️**Zoom Meeting ID**: 687 395 3555  
  
📃Abstract:     
Individuals living with dementia who lose the ability to speak, are at increased risk of isolation from the social world as caregivers struggle to communicate with them. Adaptive Interaction (AI) uses nonverbal channels to connect with people living with dementia who can no longer speak. Care staff and family members can use AI to interact and build caregiving relationships with people who cannot speak using the ‘fundamentals of communication”. Building on this evidence base, the MEAD project is developing a new measure to support ongoing opportunities for meaningful engagement, authentic caring relationships and creating and maintaining a supportive community for individuals who can no longer speak. This presentation will introduce AI and the work being undertaken in the MEAD project.
