We are investigating how to use gamification methods to collect linguistic data, especially phonetic data. In Kim, Kogan, Zhang (2023) below, we discussed the potential rationales and importance of gamifying linguistic experiments. As a follow-up, we are trialling a gamified system for a (socio-)phonetic project.
