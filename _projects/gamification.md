We are advocating using gamification methods to collect linguistic data, especially phonetic data. In Kim, Kogan, Zhang (2023) below, we discussed the potential rationales and importance of gamifying linguistic experiments. As a follow-up, we are trialling a gamified system for a (socio-)phonetic project.


## Think you know North East accents? North East Language Game

Currently, we (Dr. Cong Zhang, Yanyu Li, Damar Hoogland, and Dr. Daniel Duncan) are collecting game data through [this link](http://to-add-when-live):

If you are one of our game players, the following resources may interest you:
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}participant_info/">Participant Information Sheet</a>  
This link contains information you are informed about before your participation.
 
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}debriefing/">Debriefing</a>  
This page will contain any information, such as the target answers for the game questions,  latest updates for our study results, and pulications.
