You have been invited to take part in this study because you showed interests and you are eligible for the study.  

- If you agree to take part in this study, you will follow the next three steps: 1)tell us some simple information about yourself (1min); 2) listen to some audio clips and identify the accents in the game (5min). If you want to enter the prize pool, you will need to leave your contact details. You will be given specific instructions before each task.  

- Your participation in this study will take approximately 10 minutes.  
  
- Once research has been completed, we will debrief you on the main findings of the research by subscribing to email alerts of major updates [form](https://forms.office.com/e/4XBrHP1HLv). Or you can follow [this page](https://congzhang-linguist.github.io/project/gamification/debriefing/) for answers to the game and the latest updates of this project. You will also have access to any publications derived from this project.   

- It is completely voluntary to participate in this game. The overall top three players will be eligible to win a £30 (first place), £20 (second place), and £10 (third place)  Sainsbury's or Tesco voucher. In the event of a tie, the winner will be determined through a draw. All others who enter their contact details will be entered into a prize draw for chances to win one of ten £10 vouchers.

- You are free to decide whether or not to participate. If you decide to participate, you are free to withdraw at any time without any negative consequences for you.  

- Any information you provide during the experiment, will be kept in a password-protected electronic database, tagged with an anonymous ID number. The documents that contain your contact information (if you decide to enter the prize draw) will be protected by passwords in password-protected folders, which are only known by the researchers. This means that any anyone with access to the electronic information will not be able to identify you as an individual. The only way to link your experiment data with your contact details is to access both password-protected folders. It is very unlikely that anyone outside of the research team will be able to do this.  

- Anonymised data will be uploaded to an online repository (the Open Science Framework) to be shared with other researchers for research purpose only. It is impossible for anyone to identify you as an individual from this information alone.  

- Your rights to access, change or move your information are limited, as Newcastle University needs to manage your information in specific ways in order for the research to be reliable and accurate under UK General Data Protection Regulations. If you withdraw from the study, Newcastle University will keep the information about you that has already been obtained. To safeguard your rights, the minimum personally-identifiable information will be used. You can find out more about how Newcastle University uses your information at http://www.ncl.ac.uk/data.protection/PrivacyNotice and/or by contacting Newcastle University’s Data Protection Officer (Maureen Wilkinson, [rec-man@ncl.ac.uk](rec-man@ncl.ac.uk)).
