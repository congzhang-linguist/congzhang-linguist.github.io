I was a research assistant for [Dr. Clare Wright](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/languages/staff/1258/dr-clare-wright). I helped with coding and analysing speech data in Praat, transcribed speech data into text using CHAT (CLAN).

We used both temporal measures and linguistic/fluency measures for the analysis.
We nearly published a protocol for transcribing and annotating Mandarin L2 fluency data.
