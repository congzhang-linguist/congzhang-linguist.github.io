I had research experiences in psycholinguistics (behavioural experiences, eye-tracking experiments, and EEG experiments), language acquisition, applied linguistics, computational linguistics, etc.

## My Postdoc research

SPRINT, i.e. Speech Prosody in Interaction: The form and function of intonation in human communication, is a  project funded by the European Research Council (ERC-ADG-835263), PI: Professor Amalia Arvaniti. Please visit [https://www.sprintproject.io/](https://www.sprintproject.io/) for full information. 

 

## My DPhil research

My DPhil thesis, supervised by Professor Aditi Lahiri, was about the intonational tunes in a tonal language — Tianjin Mandarin:


I have updated almost all analyses in the thesis for journal publications. I added analyses using fPCA, desicion tree/random forest, clustering, etc. to support the analysis I made in the thesis.
